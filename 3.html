    <h1>Threat Modelling: Understanding and Mitigating Security Risks</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Threat modelling is a structured approach to identifying and evaluating potential security threats to a system, application, or organization. It helps in understanding the potential risks and vulnerabilities that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical assets.</p>
        <p>Here's a comprehensive overview of threat modelling:</p>

        <div class="highlight">
